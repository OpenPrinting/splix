A special thanks for Keith White who helped me to debug several points and add
the support for asymetric resolution support and translate the SPL2
documentation. Thanks again!

Another thanks to Rick Richardson and its work on the JBIG algorithm also
known as algorithm 0x13.

Thank you to Timo Juhani Lindfors who helped me to solve lots of bugs contained
in the SpliX 2.0.0 release candidate
