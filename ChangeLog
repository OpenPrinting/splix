	* Moved the cms profiles from cups/model/MFR/cms to cups/profiles/MFR
	  to stop making cups-driverd issuing error messages (SF: #3319110)

	* Add missing delete[] in two error paths (SF patch #3302528).

	* Fixed double free in pstoqpdl filter, which happens when the
	  color profile collection is missing files. Thanks to Leonardo Hamada
	  for thr patch (Ubuntu bug #714259, SF: #3124844).

Sat Feb 19 19:23:01 2011 Till Kamppeter <till DOT kamppeter AT gmail DOT com>

	* Link with libpthread when building with multithreading.

	* Added new printers:
		- Xerox WorkCentre PE114e (SF: #2853726)
		- Toshiba eSTUDIO180S (SF: #2853726)
		- Samsung ML-3471ND (SF Open Discussion forum)
		- Samsung CLP-310N (SF Open Discussion forum)

	* Updated translation files po/fr.po and po/pt.po.

	* Corrected typo in ppd/Makefile which prevented from building the
	translated PPDs.

	* Added missing build information from the Samsung ML-2240 to
	ppd/samsung.drv and ppd/Makefile.

	* Rebuilt all PPDs with ppdc of CUPS 1.4.5.

	* Added support for the following QPDL-3 printers (SF: #3046271):
		- Samsung ML-1660
		- Samsung ML-1910
		- Samsung ML-1915
		- Samsung ML-2525
		- Samsung ML-2525W
		- Samsung ML-2580
		- Samsung ML-2580N
		- Samsung SCX-4600
		- Samsung SCX-4623F
		- Samsung SCX-4623FW
		- Samsung SCX-5330N
		- Samsung SCX-5530FN

	* Samsung ML-3050, ML-3051, and ML-3051ND are also QPDL 3, corrected.

	* Allow QPDL Version 3 in the PPD files (SF: #3046271).

	* Switched to the more lightweight JBIG85 library instead of to
	the standard JBIG library. Thanks to Jindrich Makovicka for the
	patch.

	* Fixed memory leak in the pstoqpdl filter. Thanks to Jindrich
	Makovicka for the patch.

	* On the CLP-300, SpliX sometimes produces random pixels at the
	bottom of the page. The reason is that the page image is copied to
	a buffer rounded to a band height, which is then compressed and
	sent to the printer, but the added lines are not zeroed after
	copying. The fix simply calls memset() to clear these added
	pixels. Thanks to Jindrich Makovicka for the patch.

	* Use an array of two integers, instead of an array of single
	integers which is twice as big, for the offset selection code in
	algo0x11.cpp.  The resulting binary code should be the same, but
	this change makes more clear what is happening.

Mon Aug  2 13:39:01 2010 Till Kamppeter <till DOT kamppeter AT gmail DOT com>

	* Corrected PPD version number in include/version.h. We have
	removed the "SpliX V. " from it in the PPDs to fulfill the PPD
	specs and so we have to remove the "SpliX V. " also here so that
	the PPD version checking of the driver works again.

Sun Aug  1 12:24:01 2010 Till Kamppeter <till DOT kamppeter AT gmail DOT com>

	* Added support for new printer according to user reports at

Sat Jul 31 18:41:01 2010 Till Kamppeter <till DOT kamppeter AT gmail DOT com>

	  name and not "XXX Ghostscript".

	* Set "*FileVersion:" of the PPDs to 2.0.0, to satisfy cupstestppd.

	* Fixed bashisms in compile.sh.

	* Added support for new printers according to user reports at
	  SourceForge (Open Discussion forum):
		- Samsung SCX-4216F
		- Xerox WorkCentre PE16
		- Lexmark X215 MFP

Thu Jul 29 11:56:01 2010 Till Kamppeter <till DOT kamppeter AT gmail DOT com>

	* Fixed gcc 4.5 incompatibility in src/ppdfile.cpp (Debian bug
	  #565097).

	* Fixed UI strings for the Altitude/Air Pressure options. In the UI
	  strings the settings "High" and "Low" were the wrong way around
	  (Ubuntu LP: #605539).

	* Added support for new printers according to user reports at
	  SourceForge (bug tracker, forums) and Ubuntu (Launchpad):
		- Samsung SCX-4100 (SF: #2980269)
		- Samsung SCX-4300 (Help forum)
		- Samsung ML-2015 (SF: #2975570)
		- Samsung ML-2240 (Open Discussion forum)
		- Samsung ML-3051(ND) (SF: #2927884)
		- Samsung CLP-610ND (Ubuntu LP: #505423, LP: #510832)
		- Samsung SF-565P (Open Discussion forum)
		- Xerox Phaser 3124 (SF: #2802175)

	* Applied patch from SourceForge (ID: 2880411):
		Reorganized code and handle of white scanlines issue.

		A printable page is divided in a number of horizontal bands
		that is 128 pixels height in 600dpi or 64 pixels height at
		300dpi mode.
		There was a case error in the encoder when the band begins
		with blank scan-lines, this made the encoded band as if there
		was exactly 129 pixels in height (or 65 pixels at 300 dpi).
		When this 129th scan-line was decoded on the printer, this
		scan-line appeared at some location on the page near the
		affected band, in studied case of the dump file sent, just
		over it.
		These mysterious marks were in fact the last scan-line of
		the band but it was offset by one scan-line down out of the
		band area and the printer put it on other location.

	* Applied patch from SourceForge (ID: 2823497):
		After upgrading to CUPS 1.3.11, SpliX stopped working due to
		changes in the Postscript produced - it does not start with
		%%Creator, but with %%LanguageLevel tag. The attached patch
		adds %%LanguageLevel check to the respective if condition so
		the end of header is recognized.
