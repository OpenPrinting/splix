HOW-TO INSTALL AND USE THIS DRIVER:
===================================

Introduction:
------------

	This driver is usable by all printer devices which understand the SPL II
language. It covers several _Samsung_, _Xerox_, _Dell_ and _Ricoh_ printers like
the ML-2250 which uses it as a native printer language (Check the technical
documentation for more information).

Requested:
----------

	To use this driver you need.... a SPL II printer! Last but not least you
need CUPS. It has been tested with CUPS V. 1.1.23, 1.3.0  and worked fine of 
course..

	If you're using a distribution with a real package manager you need to
install the cups developement package (libcups...-devel or something like that).
Sometimes, the program "pppdo" is needed. It is located in the _cupsddk_
package. Finally, the libjbig is needed.

Summary:
	* CUPS
	* libcups
	* libjbig
	* cupsddk (?)

Installation:
-------------

	If you're CUPS installation is not locate in /usr, please edit and
update the Makefile.

	Then, perform the compilation by doing:

		$ make

	If no errors appear you can install the filter and the drivers in the
super user environment:

		$ su
		Password: (Enter the root password and try again if it fails :)
		# make install

	To finish you have to visit http://localhost:631 with your favourite
browser and add a new printer by selecting the correct printer in the list.

	and HAVE FUN ;-)
