HOW-TO INSTALL AND USE THIS DRIVER:
===================================



Introduction:
------------

	This driver is usable by all printer devices which understand the QPDL
(Quick Page Description Language) language. It covers several _Samsung_, 
_Xerox_, _Dell_ and _Ricoh_ printers like the ML-2250 which uses it as a native 
printer language (Check the technical documentation for more information).



Requested:
----------

	To use this driver you need.... a QPDL printer! Last but not least you
need CUPS. It has been tested with CUPS V. 1.1.23, 1.3.0  and works fine of 
course..

	If you're using a distribution with a real package manager you need to
install the cups developement package (libcups...-devel or something like that).
To finish the libjbig is needed if the JBIG algorithm compilation isn't 
disabled.

Summary:
	* CUPS
	* libcups
	* libjbig (If the JBIG algorithm compilation isn't disabled)



Installation:
-------------

  +=======================================================================+
  |                  !!!      IMPORTANT NOTICE      !!!                   |
  +=======================================================================+
  |      If you are upgrading your current version, you MUST delete       |
  |     your printer in the CUPS interface and install it again. This     |
  |   operation MUST be done since CUPS make a copy of the PPD file and   |
  |                this file is modified between versions.                |
  +=======================================================================+

	Perform the compilation by doing (It is possible to customize some 
compilation options. Please check at the end of this file):

		$ make

	If no errors appear you can install the filter and the drivers in the
super user environment:

		$ su
		Password: (Enter the root password and try again if it fails :)
		# make install

	To finish you have to visit http://localhost:631 with your favourite
browser and add a new printer by selecting the correct printer in the list.

	and HAVE FUN ;-)



Installation of the color profile for color printers:
-----------------------------------------------------

	Color printers needs color profile files to get better results. These
files are provided by your printer manufacturer and you have to install them
manually. To do that, download the linux official drivers and locate the "cms"
directory. Install them with the command:

		# make installcms CMSDIR=/path/to/cms/directory

	Samsung color profile files are available at:

		http://splix.ap2c.org/samsung_cms.tar.bz2



Compilation options:
--------------------

	SpliX code can be tuned by using specific make options. All these
options are:

		* DISABLE_JBIG=1 [0 by default]:
			Since some of the JBIG algorithm may patented, this
			option disable the use of this algorithm. Unfortunatly
			_JBIG printers_ (such as CLP-600) won't work with SpliX.
		* DISABLE_THREADS=1 [0 by default]:
			This option will disable the use of threads in the SpliX
			code. If it is disabled, _manual duplex_ will no longer 
			work.
		* DISABLE_BLACKOPTIM=1 [0 by default]:
			A black correction algorithm is used to optimize the use
			of black and color toner on color printers. This option
			will disable the use of this algorithm. Colors of a 
			printed page will be different, more toner may be used
			and black may not be dark.
		* THREADS=XX [2 by default]:
			Specify the number of _compression_ threads to use. Note
			that compression is a full CPU time job. Specify more
			than physical CPU core avaiable may be stupid.
			For instance quad core owners should use THREADS=4.
		* CACHESIZE=XX [30 by default]:
			Specify the number of _compressed_ kept into memory
			waiting for the rendering. This option is important with
			the use of manual duplex. Note that a standard
			compressed A4 paper is about 300ko. So 30 pages into
			memory will use an average of 9Mo of RAM. Other pages
			are swapped into the disk. A little CACHESIZE value will
			increase disk access and increase the job rendering time.

	Example:

		$ make DISABLE_JBIG=1 THREADS=4 CACHESIZE=100

	This will disable the use of the JBIG algorithm. Threads and black
optimization algorithm will be compiled. Then, manual duplex will be available.
The number of compression threads will be 4 and the maximum number of compressed
pages which will be kept into the memory will be 100 (with a maximum average of
memory of 30Mo)
