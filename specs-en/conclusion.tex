\section{Conclusion}
SPL2 is a bitmap document description language.
The large amount of data generated by this approach is moderated by
a compression algorithm that reuses sequences of the preceding uncompressed
data.

Reorganizing the bands into columns allows a
compression rate of up to $99\%$, with an average of $50\%$ for a
typical document.
