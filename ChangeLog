	* Fixed gcc 4.5 incompatibility in src/ppdfile.cpp (Debian bug
	  #565097).

	* Fixed UI strings for the Altitude/Air Pressure options. In the UI
	  strings the settings "High" and "Low" were the wrong way around
	  (Ubuntu LP: #605539).

	* Added support for new printers according to user reports at
	  SourceForge (bug tracker, forums) and Ubuntu (Launchpad):
		- Samsung SCX-4100 (SF: #2980269)
		- Samsung SCX-4300 (Help forum)
		- Samsung ML-2015 (SF: #2975570)
		- Samsung ML-2240 (Open Discussion forum)
		- Samsung ML-3051(ND) (SF: #2927884)
		- Samsung CLP-610ND (Ubuntu LP: #505423, LP: #510832)
		- Samsung SF-565P (Open Discussion forum)
		- Xerox Phaser 3124 (SF: #2802175)

	* Applied patch from SourceForge (ID: 2880411):
		Reorganized code and handle of white scanlines issue.

		A printable page is divided in a number of horizontal bands
		that is 128 pixels height in 600dpi or 64 pixels height at
		300dpi mode.
		There was a case error in the encoder when the band begins
		with blank scan-lines, this made the encoded band as if there
		was exactly 129 pixels in height (or 65 pixels at 300 dpi).
		When this 129th scan-line was decoded on the printer, this
		scan-line appeared at some location on the page near the
		affected band, in studied case of the dump file sent, just
		over it.
		These mysterious marks were in fact the last scan-line of
		the band but it was offset by one scan-line down out of the
		band area and the printer put it on other location.

	* Applied patch from SourceForge (ID: 2823497):
		After upgrading to CUPS 1.3.11, SpliX stopped working due to
		changes in the Postscript produced - it does not start with
		%%Creator, but with %%LanguageLevel tag. The attached patch
		adds %%LanguageLevel check to the respective if condition so
		the end of header is recognized.
