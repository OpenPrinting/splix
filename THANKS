A special thanks for Keith White who helped me to debug several points and add
the support for asymetric resolution support and translate the SPL2
documentation. Thanks again!

Another thanks to Rick Richardson and its work on the JBIG algorithm also
known as algorithm 0x13 and to Leonardo Hirokazu de Souza Hamada and its work on
the compression algorithms 0x0D and 0x0E.

Thank you to Timo Juhani Lindfors who helped me to solve lots of bugs contained
in the SpliX 2.0.0 release candidate and to Jindrich Makovicka for the same
reason.

Other thanks to Koji Otani from BBR Inc., Japan. for bug resolution.

And for the ones who helped me to write the driver files:
