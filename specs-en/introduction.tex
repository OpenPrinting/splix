Some printers use a data format called \emph{SPL2} or \emph{QPDL}.
Unfortunately, since this is a proprietory closed format, it was
impossible to develop drivers able to exploit the printer's native
language to obtain, generally, better performance
(by avoiding the use of an emulator in order to print).
%???(il n'est alors plus n√©cessaire, pour l'imprimante, de passer par un 
%???emulateur). 

This is why, I studied this language closely. After several days
of analysis, here are the results of my work.
