# Driver for SPL2 and SPLc laser printers from Samsung, Xerox, Dell, Lexmark, and Toshiba

Support for printing to SPL2- and SPLc-based printers. These are most of the cheaper laser printers from Samsung, but also rebranded ones from Xerox, Dell, Lexmark, and Toshiba. This driver is especially for those models not understanding standard languages like PostScript or PCL.

Both monochrome (ML-15xx, ML-16xx, ML-17xx, ML-2xxx) and color (CLP-5xx, CLP-6xx) models are supported, and also their rebranded equivalents like the Xerox Phaser 6100 work with this driver.

Note that older SPL1-based models (ML-12xx, ML-14xx) do not work. Use these printers with the older "gdi" driver which is built into GhostScript.

See installation instructions in the INSTALL file.

The driver was created by Aur√©lien Croc (aurelien at ap2c dot org) and contains many contributions from Till Kamppeter (till dot kamppeter at gmail dot com). Development is discontinued as most modern printers do not need drivers any more.
